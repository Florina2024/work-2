                    <p>In 1917, the Austrians built a public square, where the Skanderbeg Square is located nowadays. After Tirana became the capital in 1920, and the population increased, several city plans were planned. During the time of the Albanian monarchy from 1928 to 1939, the square was composed of a roundabout with a fountain in the center. The Old Bazaar used to be established on the grounds of modern-day Palace of Culture, the Orthodox Cathedral (present-day Tirana International Hotel), while the former City Hall building, on the grounds of where the National Historical Museum is located nowadays. A statue of Joseph Stalin was erected, where today the Skanderbeg Monument is located. Besides the construction of the above new elements during communism, the statue of Albania's leader Enver Hoxha was erected at the space between the National Historical Museum and the National Bank. Following the fall of communism in 1991, the statue would be removed amid student-led demonstrations. Since June 2017, the square has been renovated and is now part of the biggest pedestrian zone in the Balkans.</p>

                    <h3>03. Et'hem Bey Mosque</h3>
                    <p>Construction was started in 1791 or 1794 by Molla Bey and it was finished in 1819 or 1821 by his son Haxhi Ethem Bey, grand-grandson of Sulejman Pasha.[2][3]

                        At the time it was built it was part of complex buildings that compose the historical center of Tirana. In front of the mosque was the old Bazaar, in east the Sulejman Pasha Mosque, which was built in 1614 and destroyed during World War II, and in the north-west the Karapici mosque.[4]
                        
                        During the totalitarianism of the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, the mosque was closed; it was declared a historical monument and underwent restorations in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[5] On January 18, 1991, despite opposition from communist authorities, 10,000 people entered the mosque carrying flags. This was at the onset of the fall of communism in Albania.[6] The event was a milestone in the rebirth of religious freedom in Albania.</p>

                        <p>Bunk Art is a Bunker Museum. A massive bunker built by the communist dictator has been converted into museum. Basically, Albania was ruled for nearly 50 years by the communist dictator Enver Hoxha. During his rule he built an enormous bunker to protect himself and his government in case of war. You can now enter the five story bunker and walk through the underground rooms. Bunk Art tells the story of Albania’s communist past. Bunk Art is a highlight when visiting Tirana, because it is an exciting experience to walk through the scary and spooky bunkerThe communist dictator ruled Albania for nearly 50 years. The dictator’s rule began in 1944 and lasted until his death in 1985. During his rule he was constantly paranoid. During his rule he was constantly paranoid. In Enver Hoxha’s mind “the enemy” was haunting Albania.  </p>

                    <h3>05. Mount Dajti National Park</h3>
                    <p>Just 25km east of Tirana is Mt Dajti National Park. It is the most accessible mountain in the country, and many locals go there to escape the city rush and have a spit-roast lamb lunch. A sky-high, Austrian-made cable car, Dajti Express, takes 15 minutes to make the scenic trip (almost) to the top (1611m).
                        The area surrounding the upper cable-car station is a bit anticlimactic. There are some 'family-friendly' activities such as shooting things with toy machine guns and hitting things with swords, or you can ride about a patch of rubbish-strewn wasteland on a pony. Get past this lot and some abandoned buildings haunted by stray dogs, and things improve immeasurably. </p>

                        <h3>06. Tirana Piramyd</h3>
                        <p>The Pyramid of Tirana, originally built as a museum dedicated to the communist dictator Enver Hoxha, has been dramatically transformed into a new kind of cultural hub. Reusing the concrete structure, the Pyramid is now an open sculpture in a new park. The park and the sculpture are home to an ensemble of colourful boxes, scattered in and around the original building that house cafés, studios, workshops, start-up offices, incubators, festivals, and classrooms where Albanian youth will learn various technology subjects for free. Steps have been added to the building’s sloping façades, allowing the people of Albania to literally walk all over the showpiece of the former dictator.
                            First opened as a museum in 1988, the Pyramid of Tirana has led numerous lives.
